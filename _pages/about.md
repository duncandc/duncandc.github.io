I am a McWilliams Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, where I work to better understand galaxies and structure formation in the Universe.

I grew up in Hot Springs, Arkansas. I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where I received a degree in physics and astronomy.  I completed my PhD under the supervison of Frank van den Bosch and Nikhil Padmanabhan at Yale University in 2018. I now live and work in Pittsburgh, PA.

Please see my Github repository for code [here](https://github.com/duncandc).

I am a lead developer on the [halotools](https://halotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project, a python package designed to study large-scale structure, cosmology, and galaxy evolution using N-body simulations and halo models.
